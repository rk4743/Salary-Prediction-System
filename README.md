# Salary-Prediction-System

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience. It leverages historical data to train the model and provides insights into the relationship between experience and salary.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- Implementing a simple linear regression model to establish the relationship between years of experience and salary.
- Training the model on the provided dataset to learn underlying patterns.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared score.
- Visualizing the training and testing set results to assess the model's predictive capabilities.
- Making salary predictions for individuals with specified years of experience using the trained model.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib

## Project Structure

- `Dataset.csv`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `salary_prediction.py`: Python script that implements the machine learning model.
- `final_model.sav`: Saved model file using joblib for future predictions.
